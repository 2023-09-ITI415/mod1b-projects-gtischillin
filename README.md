# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
My goal when making this project was to combine elements from the 3 games I have made so far and create a game of my own ideas. The game I created is one that is heavily affected by the game framework of mechanics. I wanted the game to be hard but challenging and fun so I made some mechanics that helped me achieve that goal.
